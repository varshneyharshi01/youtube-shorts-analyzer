I have a raw video and its transcript. My goal is to create effective YouTube Shorts from this content.

Transcript Chunk {index} (10-min interval):
{chunk}

Can you help me analyze the transcript? Please identify potential short clips and provide the following information for each one:

Timestamps: The start and end times for the clip.
Content Focus: A brief summary of the key message or theme of the clip.
Strategy: How to best present this clip for a short-form audience (e.g., focus on a shocking statement, use a quick pace, etc.).
Hook: A short, engaging sentence or phrase that could be used as the video's title or opening line.
Success Potential: An assessment of how likely the clip is to perform well (e.g., High, Very High, etc.).

Please present the final data in a markdown table format, with each suggestion on a separate row.
Also, include three suggested titles for each clip in the table. The titles should be attention-grabbing and suitable for YouTube Shorts.
